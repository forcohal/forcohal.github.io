   <center><h1><u><b>ANIMATION</b></u></h1></center>

      <div id="one"><h3>I started doing animation in the month of september of 2019.
        <br/> When I got "pivot anmator"(an amimation app),
        <br/> I was excited and curious to see my first animation.
        <br/> After few hours (maybe 6 or 7 hours), I made my first
        <br/>kikup animation, it was not fabulous 
        <br/>also not a trash. I didn't upload it on you tube
        <br/> because I knew that it was a bad idea.
        <br/> after a months i feel that 'pivot animator'<br/>
          is not good for animation, then I swicthed to 'blender'.</h3></div>

  <div id="two">  <h3 style="text-align: right;">It is difficult to make animation with a new app,<br/>
         because u don't know anything about it
         <br/>and you have to learn it for making   
         <br/>animations. After a month  of learning blender,
         <br/> i made my first best animation and it took seven
         <br/> days. I named this animation"traveling through the time"
         <br/>and this time i upload this video on youtube.
         <br/>I thought it will hit a score but it is not 
         <br/>happened in actual. As all youtubers have not hit a 
         <br/>score at begning, it will take some time similarly  
         <br/> my channel also doesn't score a good view.

         <div id="three"><h3>After a few month of uploading <i>"travelling 
         <br/>through the time | part one"</i> i thought to make next 
         <br/> eppisode "travelling through the time | part two".
         <br/>I didn't give it more time to make this, 
         <br/>maybe two or three days and it was first mistake. 
         <br/>It took more than thousands frame. Now I
        <br/>realise that the blender is not good for 2d animation
         <br/>but it is one of the best app for 3d animation, because 
         <br/>in this app I have to draw each frame and it is very difficult
         <br/>to draw each frame only with mouse, and their
         <br/>is no function to fill colour in figure that I draw.

  <div id="four"><h3 style="text-align: right;">Now i installed new app for animation,
            <br/><i>"synfig studio".</i> It is best app for doing animation 
            <br/>for me, because it contain everything that i want, i can
            <br/>add background, easy to draw, i can fill
            <br/>colours, and one of the most important point,
            <br/>it has a function due to which it automaticaly
            <br/>draw frame between two frames. After the two  months  
            <br/> of the installation now I learn maximum functions in 
            <br/>"synfig studio". Now my first animation of this app
            <br>is ready, this animation is so smooth and colourful
            <br/>compare to my other animation but their is
            <br/>one problem, story is not good. At last 
          <br> I upload it on youtube nad named <i>"republic day"</i>
          <h2 style="text-align: left;">
            <br/>Republic day</h2></h3></div>
